# linux-4.4.39-chipcard-driver
chipcard bringup

TODO list of fotos




INTRO - What is this? 

The code here illustrates how generally a chipcard driver via UART can be
implemented. 

It
 * is NOT a full driver,
 * does not come as patch set (as it would be common), but as copy/paste source
   Personally I think this is easier to read for others and makes it more
   independent of particular linux kernel versions
 * is NOT finalized or tested

Generally this is a hobbyist approach, which should be able to compile.

The source shows the bring up of the chipcard until the interpretation of ATR. 
After this step, the communication becomes specific to the chipcards, or in
case of ISO/IEC 7816 will be continued with setting up a PPC message to
configure the communication to the higher baud rate of operation.

I did this with synchronous chipcards and asynchronous chipcards.





BUILDING THE SOURCE

Download the specific kernel source, e.g. for this setup a Toradex kernel
patched for the VF50 board, via yocto layer.

Setup environment variables for toolchain
(the path where e.g. arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-gcc can be found)
$ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/repos/rubusclo/YOCTO/gc__sdk/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/bin/arm-poky-linux-gnueabi
$ export KERNEL_DIRECTORY="/opt/repos/rubusclo/YOCTO/gc__kernel/linux-4.4.patched__develop"

Force rebuild, by cleaning
$ ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-poky-linux-gnueabi- make clean

Prepare kernel local version (identification!! )
$ cp arch/arm/configs/iso7816_chipcard_defconfig ./.config
$ sed -i '/CONFIG_LOCALVERSION=/s/.*/CONFIG_LOCALVERSION="-20170607-chipcard05"/' ./.config

Just open "menuconfig", then close and save it
[in case make sure the following is enabled
	drivers -> character devices -> serial -> fsl lpuart and iso7816 drivers
when using pwm, then check also the corresponding driver
	drivers -> fsl pwm]
$ ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-poky-linux-gnueabi- make menuconfig

Compile zImage and dts manually
(or integrate it into your yocto layer generating the target images right away)
$ time ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-poky-linux-gnueabi- make zImage vf500-colibri-scmain.dtb





SETTING UP TFTP

I'm running the kernel+dtb via tftp. Alternatively build the regular kernel+dtb
image (fit) and flash it to the target. For the tftp setup run the folling:
$ export TFTP_DIRECTORY="/opt/tftpboot"
$ cd ${TFTP_DIRECTORY}
$ cp ${KERNEL_DIRECTORY}/arch/arm/boot/zImage .
$ cp ${KERNEL_DIRECTORY}/arch/arm/boot/dts/*.dtb ./dts/





RUNNING THE TARGET
(zImage+dtb via ftp)

Reboot target, stop at uboot, set up the environment.
On the tftp server set up to something, e.g.
$ sudo vi /etc/default/tftpd-hpa
    (...)
    TFTP_DIRECTORY="/opt/repos/rubusclo/YOCTO/gc__kernel/linux-4.4.patched__develop/arch/arm/boot"
    (...)

the kernel was built for ARM, with LOADADDR 0x81000000

# network:
=> setenv ipaddr 10.19.19.234
=> setenv serverip 10.19.19.129
=> setenv netmask 255.255.252.0
=> setenv gatewayip 10.19.16.1
=> setenv hostname crdx-nxpaula
=> setenv ethaddr 00:14:2d:4b:c2:eb
=> setenv netdev eth0
=> setenv addip 'setenv bootargs ${bootargs} ip=${ipaddr}:${serverip}:${gatewayip}:${netmask}:${hostname}:${netdev}:off panic=1'

# kernel: set address and name of the kernel uImage file
# the kernel here is a FIT image (uImage + FDT)
=> setenv kernel_addr 0x81000000
=> setenv kernel_file zImage
# test with:
# => tftp ${kernel_addr} ${kernel_file}

# dtb:
=> setenv fdt_addr 0x82000000
=> setenv fdt_file dts/vf500-colibri-scmain.dtb
# test
# => tftp ${fdt_addr} ${fdt_file}

## console:
=> setenv console ttyLP0
=> setenv baudrate 115200
=> setenv mtdparts 'mtdparts=vf610_nfc:128k(vf-bcb)ro,1408k(u-boot)ro,512k(u-boot-env),-(ubi)'
=> setenv setup 'setenv setupargs console=tty1 console=${console},${baudrate}n8 consoleblank=0 ${mtdparts}'

## bootstrap environment
=> setenv ubiargs 'ubi.mtd=ubi root=ubi0:rootfs rootfstype=ubifs ubi.fm_autoconvert=1'
=> setenv boot_tftp 'run setup; setenv bootargs ${addip} ${ubiargs} ${setupargs}; ubi part ubi && tftp ${kernel_addr} ${kernel_file} && tftp ${fdt_addr} ${fdt_file}; bootz ${kernel_addr} - ${fdt_addr}'

## store the above setup executing 'saveenv' on the uboot shell

## in future, reboot, stop at uboot, execute 
=> run boot_tftp





THEORY

Several types of cards are on the market, ranging from pure memory cards up to
featurefull crypto something, depending on the price. Generally there are
 - Contactless Cards (RFID)
 - Contact Cards - ISO/IEC 7816
 - Multicompound Cards
This project deals with Contact Chipcards.

Signal lines:
    VCC  GND
	RST  VPP (opt.)
    CLK  IO
    NC   NC  (both opt.)

1.) Synchronous Contact Cards
The signals are aligned to CLK ticks, one bit corresponds to one tick. Hence no
additional start-, stop- or parity-bits are needed. Synchronous communication
should be denser and thus faster than asynchronous.

ISO/IEC 7816-10 Electronic signals and answer to reset for synchronous cards.


2.) Asynchronous Contact Cards
Most memory cards are asynchronous cards (still 2017). One bit corresponds to
372 CLK ticks. The ticks are rather driving the chipcard processor. Since the
ticks are not clocking communication, the communication works by asynchronous
means, i.e. start bit, parity bit and two wait bits (similar to serial
communication). Communication thus is more fault tolerant than synchronous.

ISO/IEC 7816-3 Electronic signals and transmission protocols
ISO/IEC 7816-4 Industry commands for interchange


UARTs with ISO7816 Mode
Some UARTs, e.g. NXP aka Freescale's UART offer a special "ISO7816 Mode". To my
investigation this will mean that the UART is going to detect ATR, and setup
its registers by the information received via the ATR, noteably the baud rate,
signal inversation or LSB/MSB settings. It further should be able to operate
NACK or overflow error handlings and sort of timeouts and corresponding
resends.





DEVICE TREE SETUP

driver used by default:
drivers/tty/serial/fsl_lpuart.c

Which UART is used? The interface naming varies depending on the documentation:
UART_C (Toradex)   ->   SCI1 (VF50/NXP)   ->   /dev/ttyLP1 (Linux on the target)

[information: Pawel Studler]
UART_A -> SCI0 -> UART0 -> Console
UART_B -> SCI2 -> UART2 -> ETMA
UART_C -> SCI1 -> UART1 -> ChipCard
UART_D -> SCI4 -> UART4 -> BIO-Bus
UART_E -> SCI3 -> UART3 -> DRIVE RS422


GPIOs

In a summary the list of GPIOs boils down to the following table

SODIMM    Toradex       VF50    VF50        Colibri                    Product
PIN       Name          GPIO    Signal      GPIO                       IO Name
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19        UART_C_RX     PTB5    SCI1_RX     VF610_PAD_PTB5__GPIO_27    Chip_EN
21        UART_C_TX     PTB4    SCI1_TX     VF610_PAD_PTB4__GPIO_26    Chip_IO 
81        UART_C_CTS    PTB7    SCI1_CTS    VF610_PAD_PTB7__GPIO_29    Chip_CLK
                                           , alternatively PWM set to this GPIO
94        UART_C_RTS    PTB6    SCI1_RTS    VF610_PAD_PTB6__GPIO_28    Chip_RST





SOURCE

The source is ment to be a code snippet how things can be implemented. It is
NOT a full fledged driver or driver at all. Unlock, Read, Write operations are
missing and highly depending on the particular chipcard. Once achieved an ATR
and being able to send via IO, it becomes easy, though, to implement the
specific read/write operations.





ABBREVIATIONS

ATR (Answer to Reset)
Typically a chipcard answers to a single Reset impulse combined with some clock
ticks at very low speed. The ATR then is the answer of the chipcard which
baudrate and communication preferences shall be used for further communication.

PPC (Protocol and Parameter Change)
Configuration command for asynch chipcards, how to carry on communication.
Initially the baudrate is on a very low level (around 9600). The chipcard then
communicates what it is able to deal with. Typically then a PPC will set up the
communication to the highest possible baudrate.

T0 and T1 Protocol
In ISO/IEC7816 a serial send of bits (T0) or a blockwise sending are
configurable.

TPDU (Transmission Protocol Data Unit)
The data frame to be sent over the IO line, the commands are described in the
chipcard's datasheet.

APDU (Application Protocl Data Unit)
A wrapper over a TPDU frame, e.g. ALPAR is such a protocol when communicating
with NXP's TDA8029 card reader IC, which then talks to the chipcard. APDU's
format are described in e.g. some ALPAR standard or the cardreader's datasheet.
